## Usage

Given a personal blog, when the user loads the app, then they are presented with the landing page containing a form with labels and inputs for username, blog title, and blog content.

When the user submits the form, the blog post data is stored to localStorage. When the form submits, then they are redirected to the posts page.

When the user tries to submit a form without a username, title, or content, they are presented with message that prompts them to complete the form.

When the user view the posts page, they are presented with a header, with a light mode/dark mode toggle, and a "Back" button. When the light/dark mode is clicked, the page content's styles update to reflect the selection. When the "Back" button is clicked, then the user is redirected back to the landing page where they can input more blog entries.

When the user view the main content, they are presented with a list of blog posts that are pulled from localStorage. When they view localStorage, they are presented with a JSON array of blog post objects, each including the post author's username, title of the post, and post's content. When the user takes a look at a single blog entry in the list, they can see the title, the content, and they author of the post.

When the user views the footer, then they are presented with a link to the developer's portfolio.
